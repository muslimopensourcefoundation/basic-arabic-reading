# Contributing



Thank you for helping build Basic Arabic Reading.



## How We Work

- Async-first. Propose changes via PR with a clear summary.

- Separate code and content licensing:

  - Code: MIT

  - Lesson content based on the book: CC BY-SA 4.0



## Proposals

- Architectural decisions start with a proposal using `docs/Architecture-Proposal-Template.md`.

- Submit proposals as PRs under `docs/architecture/` (create the folder if needed).



## Issues and Labels

- Use issue templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`.

- Labels:

  - `good-first-issue` for onboarding tasks

  - `content` for lesson mapping and exercises

  - `backend` for APIs, auth, data model

  - `frontend` for UI and UX

  - `infra` for CI, deployment, tooling



## PR Checklist

- Clear description and rationale

- Tests or manual test notes when applicable

- Updated docs if behavior or contracts change

- Pass basic lint/format checks
