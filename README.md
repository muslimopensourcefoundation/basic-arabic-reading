# Basic Arabic Reading (Open Source)



An open-source, self-paced web app that teaches beginners how to read Arabic. The curriculum is based on the book **Basic Arabic Reading** by Beder Bourahmah and is adapted for interactive practice.



## Mission

Empower the global Muslim community to gain Islamic and software engineering knowledge freely through open-source collaboration, education, and innovation.



## Project Overview

This app turns the book's progressive lessons into interactive exercises:

- Letter recognition and names

- Joining forms and special cases

- Short and long vowels

- Sukoon, shadda, hamza

- Sun and moon letters

- Wuqoof and ta marbutah

- Staged reading into fluent reading



## Tech Stack Policy

Stack is flexible. Any modern backend is acceptable (.NET C#, Python, Go, Ruby, TypeScript/Node.js, etc.), any modern relational DB (MSSQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL), and any reasonable frontend. Contributors propose an architecture in `docs/Architecture-Proposal-Template.md` and submit it for approval via PR.
