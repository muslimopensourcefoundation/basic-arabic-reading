# Architecture Proposal



## Summary

What stack are you proposing and why is it a good fit?



## Components

- Backend: language, framework, and major libraries

- Frontend: framework, routing, state

- Database: engine and ORM

- Deployment: hosting, CI, and environment strategy



## Data Model

List key entities (e.g., Lesson, Exercise, Prompt, Attempt, UserProgress) with fields and relationships.



## API Surface

List endpoints or contracts for:

- Auth (if any)

- Lesson retrieval

- Practice generation (RNG)

- Progress save/load



## RNG Design

How will letters, vowels, and joined forms be randomly selected, constrained, and validated?



## Accessibility and i18n

Keyboard navigation, readable fonts for Arabic, and language toggles.



## MVP Scope

What will be implemented in the first milestone?



## Risks and Tradeoffs

Complexity, ops overhead, maintainability.
