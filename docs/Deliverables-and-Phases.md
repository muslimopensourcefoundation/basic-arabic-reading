# Deliverables and Phases



## Phase 1 — Proposal

- Review the book curriculum (available via project lead or shared Google Drive)

- Submit an architecture proposal using `docs/Architecture-Proposal-Template.md`

- Outline API endpoints, data model, and deployment approach

- Provide a small spike or proof-of-concept if helpful



## Phase 2 — MVP Scaffolding

- Initialize repo structure for chosen stack and app

- Implement content ingestion for lesson data (start with Lessons 1–3)

- Implement RNG-driven practice endpoints or modules

- Basic UI for practice sessions and lesson navigation

- Local persistence (e.g., localStorage) for progress



## Phase 3 — Documentation and Release

- Contributor docs, issue templates, and starter tasks

- Clear separation of content (CC BY-SA) and code (MIT)

- Public launch of the repo for wider contribution



## Phase 4 — Iteration

- Add Lessons 4–6 practice flows

- Add audio examples (if available)

- Improve accessibility and internationalization
